Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Area
{
public:
    void output(int l, int b)
    {
        cout<<"Area of Rectangle is = "<<l*b<<endl;
    }

    void output(int a)
    {
        cout<<"Area of Square is = "<<a*a<< endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Area obj;
    obj.output(5,6);
    obj.output(5);
}
